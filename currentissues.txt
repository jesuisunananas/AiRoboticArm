Design/Build:
What materials should we use? (plastic vs. metal)
going to use plastic for now, metal will be too heavy
Where should we buy materials from?
?? home depot
What type of robotic joints are used in arm?
base will be revolving joint
2 rotational joints as the other 2
Stepper Motor or Servo Motor?
Servo fs
Should we have different attachments?
Not now, will implement claw or sticky later
What microcontroller should we use?
arduino uno

Code:
What capabilities should we add to the arm?
Arm will travel in 3 planes of motion in terms of camera
<--->, up and down, in and out
these will translate to
rotation, lower joint, upper joint

What branches of ML should we explore?
Rn CV, later maybe NLP, do we need lalba?
